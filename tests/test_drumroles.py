"""sideman.drumroles.hit_groups on synthetic drum stems at 124 BPM whose answers follow from how they are built.

Needs the `listen` extra:  uv run --extra listen pytest tests/test_drumroles.py -q
Skipped (not failed) when numpy or soundfile is missing. Tests that take over 6 s are marked `slow`:
`-m "not slow"` leaves them out, a plain run includes them.

Conventions used below: bar 0 starts at T0; a 16th is 60 / 124 / 4 s; step 0 is the downbeat, 4 / 8 / 12 are the other
beats, and the offbeats ("and" of each beat) are steps 2, 6, 10, 14, so `s % 4 == 2`. Every hit has its own noise seed
and a gain within +-2 dB.
